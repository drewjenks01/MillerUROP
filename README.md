Python code developed to analyze neurophysiological data during a context-association task. 
- Extracts spike and LFP data from files, aggregates data across all files and sessions into specific neural areas and tasks
- pre-processes spiking data
- runs a multiple regression analysis with 6 different feature categories
- calculates and plots percent explained variance of three neural areas within the feature categories
- runs a categoricality test
- implements multiple significance tests
